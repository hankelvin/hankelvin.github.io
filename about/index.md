üëã Hi! My name is Kelvin, I have been working on ways to automatically process questions (generating, decomposing and answering ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì) for the last 5 years, from text, from knowledge graph, simple to complex. 

I did my PhD (on question generation, naturally) at the [Universit√© de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/en/univ-lorraine/) in the lovely city of [Nancy, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy,_France) under the supervision of [Claire Gardent](https://members.loria.fr/CGardent) and [Thiago Castro Ferreira](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WvXZlDIAAAAJ). My PhD was carried out under [Project QUANTUM](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-19-CE23-0025) which was funded by the French National Research Agency (_Agence National de Recherche, ANR_), and I was part of the [Synalp](https://synalp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/synalp-website) team (now within the MosAIk group) at the [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/en/) (_Laboratoire lorrain de Recherche en Informatique et ses Applications_) laboratory. 

<!-- Before that, I did my MSc (Natural Language Processing) at the [_Institut des sciences du Digital, Management & Cognition (IDMC)_](https://idmc.univ-lorraine.fr/) in the Universit√© de Lorraine. I also hold an MA (South-east Asian Studies) from the National University of Singapore where I focused on Indonesian political economy. I did my BSc (Economics) with a minor in Political Science from the Singapore Management University. -->

Recently, I've been working on question generation useful for discourse representations and on post-training LLMs with reinforcement learning. Some of my recent work can be found here:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚öíÔ∏è [decomposing complex questions](https://github.com/hankelvin/complex_question_decomposition) {% sidenote "sidenote-decomp" "Here I proposed the use of panels of smaller-sized LLMs to obtain decomposition candidates as well as to select from them via voting (ranking with LLM-as-judge)." %}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìú [generating Questions under Discussion (QUD)](https://github.com/hankelvin/grpo_qud_generation) {% sidenote "sidenote-qud" "Here I proposed using reinforcement learning (GRPO) to obtain improved question generation that have to meet multiple constraints requiring reasoning over a piece of discourse. _QUD is an emerging linguistic framework for representing discourse structure; see [here](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.84.pdf) for a natural language processed-focused survey._" %}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üî¢ [captcha recognition](https://github.com/hankelvin/captcha_solvers) {% sidenote "sidenote-visual" "This work is exploratory and was rapidly prototyped, and the images are in a controlled setting. Here I used GRPO with a small set of exemplars to help improve vision language model (VLM) recognition of ambiguous characters." %}
